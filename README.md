# Word Hunt Game

This is a word hunt game that I created using Python.
In this game, you will have a 10x10 grid filled with letters and a word search list.
You can click-drag over the letters to form words where letters are connected in any direction.
The minimum number of letters per word is three.
If you find a word from the list, it will be highlighted in the grid.
If you find a word that is not in the list, you will get credit for a bonus word.
You win the game by finding all the words in the list.

## Features to be added:
- Change it so that there is an Original mode (with word search and bonuses), and a ZEN mode that does not give a word search list at all but does checks to make sure the user has not found all possible words (no words will stay highlighted in this mode). Make sure to add the button options before the grid appears.
- Add mode that allows a timed edition with a score per word depending on the size of the word (bigger the word, higher the value of the word). No words will stay highlighted.
- Add difficulty settings that can either change the word difficulty or the grid size/max word length.
- Add a themed challenge mode that has a list of words per theme at random. If Original mode, the theme will be displayed at the top. If Secret mode, there will be no word search list showing to the user, but the words in the secret themed list will be highlighted when found. At the end, the theme will be displayed or the user needs to guess the theme. Bonus words are still allowed in this mode.
